# Project 5


Plan:
Changing the data structure for the BST from linked list to a non-linked list (dynamic array). 
Taking into consideration, that inserts to the left are inserted at the index of (2*i+1) and to the left (2*i+2). Also, remove is been handled accordingly. 

Changes: 
-> Modify the dictionary file as appropriately to handle the new data structure. 
-> Deleted some of the functions in the dictionary for simplicity. 
-> Modify the encounter and inventory files to account for the deleted functions and the new data structure.
